# GLOBAL ECONOMIC FLOW OBSERVATORY (GEFO)
## STRATEGIC MEMO

**Document Generated:** February 20, 2026

---

## MISSION

Build a geoeconomic intelligence platform combining macroeconomic data and physical trade flows in a 3D geospatial interface.

---

## VISION

Create the leading independent geoeconomic monitoring platform for funds, institutions, researchers, and policymakers.

---

## VALUE PROPOSITION

- **Integrates macro + shipping + geographic risk** — Combines trade statistics, shipping patterns, and geopolitical chokepoints
- **Visualizes trade flows dynamically** — Interactive 3D globe with real-time layer toggling
- **Provides proprietary stress indicators** — Trade Flow Intensity Index, Port Stress, Energy Corridor Risk
- **Enables geopolitical risk monitoring** — Tracks anomalies in critical chokepoints

---

## TARGET USERS

| Segment | Use Case |
| --- | --- |
| **Hedge Funds** | Macro trade positioning, supply chain risk |
| **Energy Traders** | Oil/gas corridor monitoring, chokepoint alerts |
| **Shipping Insurers** | Port congestion, maritime route risk |
| **Ministries** | Trade policy, supply chain resilience |
| **Academic Researchers** | Geoeconomic analysis, publication support |

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

**We focus on interpretation and synthesis rather than raw tracking.**

Competitors (MarineTraffic, FlightRadar24) collect data.  
We analyze relationships and generate intelligence.

Key differentiator:
- Macro + shipping correlation
- Proprietary indicators
- Chokepoint stress scoring
- Geopolitical context

---

## LONG-TERM GOAL

Become a recognized geoeconomic intelligence provider within 5 years.

### Success Indicators
- 100+ paying Pro subscribers
- 5–10 institutional contracts
- Published research cited by policymakers
- Industry recognition (Davos, UN, IMF mentions)

---

## Strategic Timeline

| Period | Objective |
| --- | --- |
| **Months 1–3** | MVP globe + basic data layers |
| **Months 4–6** | Proprietary indicators + first report |
| **Months 7–12** | Payment system + first 10 subscribers |
| **Year 2** | Institutional sales focus |
| **Years 3–5** | Scale to market leader |

---

## Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Data access bottlenecks | Diverse public API sources + manual data |
| No institutional traction | Pivot to academic + newsletter revenue |
| Technical scaling | Start simple, scale incrementally |
| Copycat competition | Focus on synthesis/analysis depth, not tracking |

---

## Core Principles

✅ **Intellectual-first approach** — Insights > infrastructure  
✅ **Low burn rate** — Bootstrap until profitable  
✅ **Quality over speed** — Rigorous methodology  
✅ **Independent perspective** — No corporate bias  
✅ **Transparency** — Clear data sources + methodology
